                                        Data Breaches has become a common problem nowadays, not in a particular country
                                        that, I am pointing out.
                                        It is happening all over the world. It happens all over the world. I used some
                                        visualizations to overcome this issue to
                                        some extent by looking at Type of breach, Company impacted by it and which
                                        organization mostly attacks. I showcased
                                        on the highest breach happened from the year 2009-2018 based on the attributes
                                        given in the dataset. Statements are for companies
                                        related to data breaches where I saw data of the company that affected but also
                                        customers and vendors having difficulty.
                                        The data for this topic comes from the Privacy Rights Clearing House. Dataset is
                                        with factors like Year, Company, State, Total Records,
                                        Latitude, Longitude, Description of Incident etc

                                        In the below diagram, I have displayed the histogram, by plotting the Year of
                                        the breach in the x-axis and count of attacks on the y-axis.
                                        And I have represented it, naming the distribution of breaches by year. When I
                                        look at the histogram, 2017 is the year where hackers are mostly
                                        concentrated. In that year, i see the highest breach count. Until 2013, I do not
                                        see so many data breach happening, but it started increasing from 2014.
                                        And the state becomes vice versa every year, but I see the increased state from
                                        2014

                                        In the below diagram, I have displayed the barplot by plotting the Breach Type
                                        in the x-axis and count of it on the y-axis.
                                        And I have represented it naming the count of breach types. When I look at
                                        barplot HACK is a breach which is topmost breach type where most hackers use it.
                                        Rest second and third positions are covered by DISC and PHYS.In this barplot, i
                                        see the most prominent data breach type.
                                        HACK is breach type with a count of 250. Remaining all having the count below
                                        100.
                                        So, if companies attacked by this type of breach, will be careful this problem
                                        may be eradicated. Other companies also should know more about this type of
                                        breach and know the ways to stop attacked by this type of breach.

                                        In the below diagrams, I plotted the geo maps by taking the State column data and combining it with the total number of records.
                                         And now I got to know which State has the highest number of records saying that this state is most commonly affected with the data breaches. 
                                         Based on this information also I got to know which state should protect the data from the hackers. I got to know how many times each state is 
                                         affected.

                                In this project, I dealt with different types of breaches and tell people who are worried about it. 
                                These are areas, which are to be improved and vendors, be able to see which is the most important breach, happening 
                                frequently. By using the 'Description of Incident' column, we can eradicate the attacks which are coming in future by 
                                using some methodologies. I conclude saying that factors to protect the company from data breaches are giving limited 
                                access to secure database which is Information source in this dataset and keeping passwords which are quite lengthy for 
                                these type of databases.
